              <h3>Under-Counter Bar Refrigerators</h3>
              <p>
                Under-counter bar refrigerators are a popular choice for bars
                and restaurants due to their space-saving design and easy
                accessibility. These units fit snugly beneath the counter,
                allowing bartenders to quickly grab beverages and ingredients
                without leaving their station. Common repair needs for
                under-counter bar refrigerators include issues with the
                thermostat, which can lead to improper cooling and spoilage of
                stored items. Problems with the door seal are also frequent,
                resulting in energy loss and inefficient cooling. Regular
                maintenance, such as cleaning the condenser coils and checking
                the refrigerant levels, can help prevent these issues and ensure
                the unit operates efficiently.

              <h3>Back Bar Coolers</h3>
              <p>
                Back bar coolers are designed to store and display beverages
                behind the bar, providing easy access for bartenders and an
                attractive display for customers. These coolers often feature
                glass doors and adjustable shelving, making them ideal for
                showcasing a variety of drinks. Common repair needs for back bar
                coolers include malfunctioning compressors, which can lead to
                inadequate cooling and potential beverage spoilage.
                Additionally, issues with the internal lighting system can
                affect the display's appeal. Routine maintenance, such as
                cleaning the evaporator fan and inspecting the door gaskets, can
                help keep back bar coolers running smoothly and looking their
                best.

              <h3>Kegerators</h3>
              <p>
                Kegerators are specialized refrigerators designed to store and
                dispense kegs of beer, making them a staple in many bars and
                restaurants. These units typically include a refrigeration
                system, a tap, and a CO2 tank to keep the beer carbonated and
                fresh. Common repair needs for kegerators include issues with
                the CO2 system, such as leaks or regulator malfunctions, which
                can affect the quality of the beer. Problems with the cooling
                system, such as a faulty thermostat or compressor, can also
                impact the beer's temperature and taste. Regular maintenance,
                including cleaning the beer lines and checking the CO2 levels,
                is essential to keep kegerators functioning properly and serving
                up perfect pints.

              <h3>Wine Coolers</h3>
              <p>
                Wine coolers are designed to store wine at optimal temperatures,
                preserving its flavor and aroma. These units often feature dual
                temperature zones, allowing for the storage of both red and
                white wines at their respective ideal temperatures. Common
                repair needs for wine coolers include thermostat issues, which
                can lead to temperature fluctuations and potentially spoil the
                wine. Problems with the cooling system, such as a failing
                compressor or evaporator fan, can also affect the unit's
                performance. Regular maintenance, including cleaning the
                condenser coils and ensuring proper ventilation, can help
                prevent these issues and keep wine coolers operating
                efficiently.

              <h3>Display Refrigerators</h3>
              <p>
                Display refrigerators are used in bars and restaurants to
                showcase a variety of beverages and attract customers with their
                appealing presentation. These units often feature glass doors,
                bright internal lighting, and adjustable shelving to maximize
                visibility and accessibility. Common repair needs for display
                refrigerators include issues with the lighting system, which can
                diminish the visual appeal of the display, and problems with the
                cooling system, such as a malfunctioning compressor or
                thermostat. Regular maintenance, such as cleaning the condenser
                coils and checking the door seals, is crucial to ensure display
                refrigerators remain both functional and attractive.

                  <b>Temperature Fluctuations: </b>One of the most common issues
                  with bar refrigerators is inconsistent temperature control.
                  This can result in beverages not being chilled to the desired
                  temperature or even freezing. Temperature fluctuations can be
                  caused by a faulty thermostat, poor door seals, or a
                  malfunctioning compressor. It's crucial to ensure that the
                  refrigerator is not overstocked and that there's adequate
                  airflow around the unit. Regular maintenance, such as cleaning
                  the condenser coils and checking door gaskets, can help
                  mitigate these issues and ensure consistent cooling
                  performance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Noisy Operation: </b>Bar refrigerators can sometimes become
                  noisy, which can be particularly bothersome in a social or
                  commercial environment. Common sources of noise include the
                  compressor, evaporator fan, and condenser fan. A rattling or
                  humming noise could indicate that the refrigerator is not
                  level, or that there are loose components. Regularly
                  inspecting the unit for any loose parts and ensuring it is
                  placed on a stable, level surface can help reduce noise. If
                  the noise persists, it might be necessary to call a
                  professional to inspect the internal components.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Frost Buildup: </b>Frost buildup inside a bar refrigerator
                  can compromise its efficiency and reduce storage space. This
                  issue is often due to warm, moist air entering the
                  refrigerator, which can happen if the door isn't sealed
                  properly or is frequently opened. Another cause could be a
                  malfunctioning defrost timer or heater. To prevent frost
                  buildup, ensure that the door seals are intact and that the
                  refrigerator door is not left open for extended periods.
                  Regularly defrosting the unit and keeping it clean can also
                  help maintain optimal performance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Leaking Water: </b>Water leakage is a common problem with
                  bar refrigerators and can stem from several sources. A blocked
                  or frozen defrost drain can cause water to pool inside the
                  unit, while a damaged or misaligned drip pan can lead to
                  external leaks. Additionally, high humidity levels can cause
                  excess condensation, which may result in water leakage.
                  Regularly inspecting and cleaning the defrost drain and drip
                  pan, as well as ensuring that the refrigerator is properly
                  sealed and maintained, can help prevent leaks. If the issue
                  persists, it may be necessary to have a professional service
                  the unit to identify and fix the underlying cause.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Electrical Issues: </b>Electrical problems can cause a bar
                  refrigerator to stop working entirely or operate
                  inefficiently. Common electrical issues include blown fuses,
                  tripped circuit breakers, or faulty wiring. These problems can
                  arise from power surges, improper installation, or wear and
                  tear over time. To prevent electrical issues, ensure that the
                  refrigerator is plugged into a dedicated outlet and that the
                  power supply is stable. Regularly inspecting the electrical
                  components and addressing any signs of wear or damage can help
                  maintain the unit's functionality. If an electrical issue
                  occurs, it's advisable to seek professional assistance to
                  avoid the risk of electric shock or further damage.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Poor Energy Efficiency: </b>Over time, a bar refrigerator
                  may become less energy-efficient, leading to higher
                  electricity bills and reduced performance. This can be due to
                  several factors, including dirty condenser coils, an aging
                  compressor, or inadequate insulation. Poor energy efficiency
                  can also result from frequent door openings or an overloaded

                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Door Gaskets: </b>Door gaskets (or seals) are the flexible,
                  rubber-like strips that line the edges of the refrigerator
                  door, creating an airtight seal. Damaged or worn-out gaskets
                  can allow warm air to enter, causing the refrigerator to work
                  harder to maintain the set temperature, leading to increased
                  energy consumption and potential frost buildup. Replacing old
                  gaskets with new ones can enhance the refrigerator's
                  efficiency and prolong its lifespan. It's a relatively simple
                  and cost-effective repair that can make a significant

              <h3>Samsung</h3>
              <p>
                Samsung bar refrigerators are known for their sleek design and
                cutting-edge technology. However, this innovation can also lead
                to higher repair costs. Common repairs might include issues with
                the temperature control board, ice maker assembly, or condenser
                fan motor. Given the advanced technology and specialized parts,
                repairing a Samsung bar refrigerator can be more expensive, with
                costs ranging from <b>$250</b> for simpler repairs to as much as
                <b>$600</b> for more complex issues. Samsung's parts are often highly
                specific to each model, which can drive up both parts and labor costs.
                However, the brand's quality and performance often justify these
                expenses.

              <h3>LG</h3>
              <p>
                LG is another brand that combines advanced technology with
                stylish design. LG bar refrigerators often come with features
                like smart connectivity and energy-efficient components, which
                can complicate repairs. Common repairs might involve the
                thermostat, compressor, or electronic control board. Repair
                costs for LG refrigerators generally range from <b>$200</b> for simpler
                issues to <b>$550</b> for more complicated repairs. The availability
                of parts and skilled technicians can vary, but LG's commitment to
                quality usually ensures that repairs, while sometimes costly, are
                effective in extending the life of the appliance.

                repairs like replacing a door gasket to <b>$450</b> for more involved
                issues like compressor replacement. Common repairs might include
                fixing the evaporator fan motor, thermostat issues, or addressing
                defrost problems. The availability of Frigidaire parts and the brand's
                straightforward design often make repairs more manageable and less
                expensive compared to more high-tech brands.

              <p>
                Sub-Zero is a luxury brand known for its high-end, built-in
                refrigerators. Given the premium nature of these appliances,
                repair costs can be significantly higher. Common repairs might
                involve the compressor, sealed system leaks, or electronic
                control boards. The cost for repairing a Sub-Zero bar
                refrigerator can range from <b>$300</b> for simpler issues to <b
                  >$900</b
                > for more complex repairs. The specialized nature of Sub-Zero parts
                and the need for highly skilled technicians contribute to the higher
                repair costs. However, the brand‚Äôs exceptional quality and performance
                often make these repairs a worthwhile investment.

                  >$400</b
                > for more complex repairs such as compressor replacement. Common
                issues might include problems with the thermostat, evaporator fan

              <p>
                When considering repair costs, it‚Äôs important to weigh the age
                and condition of your refrigerator against the cost of a new
                unit. Sometimes, investing in a new refrigerator can be more
                cost-effective in the long run. Always consult with a
                professional technician to get a precise estimate tailored to
                your specific model and issue.

              <p>
                The cost of labor for repairing a bar refrigerator can vary
                widely depending on several factors, such as geographic
                location, the complexity of the repair, and whether the repair
                is done by an independent technician or a larger service
                company. Here are some general guidelines to give you an idea of
                what to expect:
              </p>

              <b>Factors Influencing Labor Costs</b>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b>Geographic Location:</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Urban Areas: Typically higher labor costs due to higher
                      living expenses.
                    </li>
                    <li>Rural Areas: Generally lower labor costs.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Type of Repair:</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Simple Repairs: Tasks like replacing a thermostat or a
                      gasket, which are usually less labor-intensive.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Complex Repairs: Involving the compressor, refrigerant
                      leaks, or electrical issues, which require more time and
                      expertise.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Service Provider:</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Independent Technicians: May offer lower rates compared to
                      larger service companies.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                      comprehensive services and warranties.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Emergency vs. Scheduled Repairs:</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Emergency Repairs: Usually cost more due to the urgency
                      and potential after-hours work.
                    </li>
                    <li>Scheduled Repairs: Typically less expensive.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ol>

              <b>Typical Labor Costs</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Basic Service Call Fee: This is the fee just for the
                  technician to come out and diagnose the problem. It usually
                  ranges from $50 to $100.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Hourly Labor Rate: After the initial diagnosis, the hourly
                  labor rate can range from $50 to $150 per hour. Some
                  technicians have a minimum charge, such as a one-hour minimum.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Flat Rate: Some companies offer flat-rate pricing for specific
                  types of repairs, which can sometimes be more economical.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <b>Example Costs</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Thermostat Replacement: $100 - $200 (including parts and

                  and labor, but can be higher depending on the model and
                  complexity).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <b>Additional Costs</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Parts: The cost of the parts needed for the repair.</li>
                <li>
                  Travel Fees: Some technicians charge extra if you are located
                  far from their base of operations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Warranty: Extended warranty or service plans may add to the
                  cost but can provide peace of mind.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <b>Tips to Save on Repair Costs</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Get Multiple Quotes: Always get at least two or three quotes
                  to compare prices.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Check for Warranties: If your bar refrigerator is still under
                  warranty, some or all repair costs may be covered.
                </li>
                <li>
                  DIY for Simple Fixes: For minor issues like a faulty gasket or
                  light bulb, consider doing it yourself if you feel
                  comfortable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Regular Maintenance: Regularly maintaining your refrigerator
                  can prevent costly repairs down the line.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Labor costs for repairing a bar refrigerator can vary, but by
                understanding the factors that influence these costs, you can
                better prepare and budget for any necessary repairs. Always get
                multiple quotes and consider both the reputation and warranty
                offered by the service provider to ensure you're getting the
                best value for your money.

                    - DIY repair can be a viable option for minor bar
                    refrigerator issues and can save money on service fees.
                    However, it's essential to weigh the potential risks and
                    benefits. Attempting to fix more complex problems on your
                    own can lead to further damage and safety concerns. If
                    you're unsure about the repair process or if the issue is
                    complicated, it's best to consult with a professional
                    technician. Trusting experts ensures that your bar
                    refrigerator is repaired correctly and safely.

                    <li>
                      How: Unplug the refrigerator, then use a vacuum or brush
                      to remove dust and debris from the condenser coils,
                      usually located at the back or underneath the unit.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

                    <li>Frequency: Clean monthly or as needed.</li>
                    <li>
                      How: Remove all items from the refrigerator, then use a
                      mixture of mild detergent and warm water to wipe down the
                      interior surfaces. Rinse with a damp cloth and dry
                      thoroughly.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                      How: Use a damp cloth and mild detergent to wipe down the
                      door seals (gaskets). Check for cracks or wear, as damaged
                      seals can cause the refrigerator to work harder.

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Why: Overloading the refrigerator can obstruct air
                      circulation, making it harder to maintain the desired
                      temperature.

                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Check Air Vents:</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Why: Ensure air vents inside the refrigerator are not
                      blocked by food items. Proper airflow is crucial for
                      efficient cooling.

                    <li>
                      Frequency: Every 6 months to 1 year, depending on usage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      How: Follow the manufacturer's instructions to replace any
                      air or water filters.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                Deciding whether to repair or replace a bar refrigerator can be
                challenging. Here are some key factors to consider, along with
                guidelines to help you make an informed decision:
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content__page-desc">
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b>Age of the Refrigerator</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Lifespan: Bar refrigerators typically last around 8-12
                      years.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Guideline: If your refrigerator is nearing or has
                      surpassed its expected lifespan, replacement may be more
                      cost-effective.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Cost of Repair vs. Replacement</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Repair Costs: Obtain a detailed estimate for the repair,
                      including labor and parts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Replacement Costs: Research the cost of a new bar
                      refrigerator with similar features.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Guideline: If the repair costs exceed 50% of the price of
                      a new unit, consider replacing it.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Energy Efficiency</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Older Models: Older refrigerators are generally less
                      energy-efficient and may result in higher utility bills.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Energy Star: Newer models often have better energy ratings
                      and can save money in the long run.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Guideline: If your current refrigerator is an older, less
                      efficient model, a replacement could reduce energy
                      consumption and operating costs.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Frequency of Repairs</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Repair History: Consider the number and frequency of
                      previous repairs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Guideline: If your refrigerator has required multiple
                      repairs in a short period, it may indicate underlying
                      issues and warrant replacement.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Performance and Condition</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Temperature Issues: Frequent inability to maintain the
                      right temperature.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Physical Condition: Check for rust, cracks, or other signs
                      of wear and tear.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Guideline: If performance is consistently poor or the
                      physical condition is deteriorating, replacement is likely
                      the better option.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Environmental Impact</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Recycling: Many new refrigerators are designed to be more
                      environmentally friendly and may be easier to recycle.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Guideline: Consider the environmental impact of disposing
                      of your old refrigerator and the benefits of a more
                      eco-friendly model.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Availability of Parts</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Older Models: Parts for older models may be harder to find
                      or more expensive.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Guideline: If parts are scarce or costly, replacing the
                      refrigerator may be more practical.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Manufacturer‚Äôs Warranty</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Warranty Coverage: Check if your refrigerator is still
                      under warranty.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Guideline: If repairs are covered under warranty, it may
                      be more economical to repair rather than replace.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>

              <b>Decision Checklist</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Age: Is the refrigerator over 8-12 years old?</li>
                <li>
                  Repair Costs: Do repair costs exceed 50% of the cost of a new
                  unit?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Energy Efficiency: Is the current model significantly less

                <li>
                  Repair Frequency: Has the refrigerator required multiple
                  recent repairs?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Performance: Is the refrigerator consistently failing to
                  perform well?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Parts Availability: Are parts for the current model hard to
                  find or expensive?
                </li>
                <li>Warranty: Is the refrigerator still under warranty?</li>
              </ul>

                    At Same Day Appliance Repair, we understand the importance
                    of keeping your bar refrigerator in optimal condition,
                    especially for businesses that rely on commercial
                    refrigeration. If your bar refrigerator is not cooling, it
                    can disrupt your operations and impact your bottom line.
                    Here are some common reasons why your commercial
                    refrigerator might not be functioning properly and how we
                    can help:
                  </p>
                  <p>Common Reasons for Cooling Issues:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <b>Faulty Thermostat: </b>The thermostat regulates the
                      temperature inside your refrigerator. A malfunctioning
                      thermostat can prevent the refrigerator from maintaining
                      the desired temperature.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Dirty Condenser Coils: </b>Over time, condenser coils
                      can accumulate dust and debris, reducing their efficiency.
                      This can cause your refrigeration equipment to struggle to
                      cool properly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Malfunctioning Compressor: </b>The compressor is a
                      critical component of your commercial refrigerator. If
                      it‚Äôs not working correctly, the refrigerator won‚Äôt be able
                      to cool.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Refrigerant Leaks: </b>Leaks in the refrigerant lines
                      can significantly impact the cooling performance. Signs of
                      a refrigerant leak include hissing sounds and reduced
                      cooling capacity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Door Seal Issues: </b>Damaged or worn-out door seals
                      can allow warm air to enter the refrigerator, making it
                      difficult to maintain the proper temperature.
                    </li>

                  <p>
                    When your bar refrigerator starts making unusual noises, it
                    can be concerning, especially if you rely on it for your
                    restaurant or business. At Same Day Appliance Repair, we
                    specialize in commercial refrigeration and are here to help
                    you diagnose and fix the issue promptly. Here‚Äôs what you
                    should do if you notice strange sounds coming from your
                    commercial refrigerator:
                  </p>
                  <b>Common Causes of Unusual Noises:</b>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <b>Loose Components: </b>Over time, components inside your
                      bar refrigerator can become loose, causing rattling or
                      banging sounds. It‚Äôs essential to review and tighten any
                      loose parts to prevent further damage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Condenser or Evaporator Fan Issues: </b>The fans in
                      your commercial refrigerator or freezer can sometimes
                      malfunction or get obstructed. This can result in buzzing,
                      clicking, or grinding noises.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Compressor Problems: </b>The compressor is a critical
                      part of your refrigeration system. If it‚Äôs failing or
                      working excessively hard, it can produce loud humming or
                      knocking sounds.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Ice Buildup: </b>Ice buildup around the fan or coils
                      can create unusual noises as the fan blades hit the ice.
                      This is common in both refrigerators and freezers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Vibration: </b>Your refrigerator might not be level,
                      causing it to vibrate and produce noise. Ensuring that it
                      is properly leveled can resolve this issue.
                    </li>
                  </ol>

                  <b>Steps to Take:</b>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <b>Inspect for Loose Components: </b>Carefully inspect the
                      refrigerator for any loose parts and tighten them as
                      needed. Pay special attention to shelves, drawers, and
                      internal fixtures.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Check the Fans: </b>Open up the access panels and check
                      the condenser and evaporator fans for obstructions or
                      signs of wear. Clean them and ensure they are spinning
                      freely.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Listen to the Compressor: </b>If the noise seems to be
                      coming from the compressor, it‚Äôs crucial to contact a
                      professional. Compressor issues can be complex and require
                      specialized knowledge to fix.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Defrost the Unit: </b>If you suspect ice buildup,
                      defrost the refrigerator to see if the noise subsides.
                      However, recurring ice buildup might indicate a deeper
                      issue that needs professional attention.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Level the Refrigerator: </b>Ensure that your bar
                      refrigerator is level on the ground. Adjust the leveling
                      legs as necessary to eliminate vibrations.
                    </li>
                  </ol>

                  <p>
                    Here are some common reasons why water might be pooling at
                    the bottom of your bar refrigerator:
                  </p>

                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <b>Clogged Defrost Drain: </b>A blocked defrost drain is a
                      frequent culprit. This drain channels excess water from
                      the defrost cycle out of your refrigerator. If it becomes
                      clogged with debris or ice, the water will accumulate at
                      the bottom instead of draining away properly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Freezer Drain Issues: </b>If your bar refrigerator has
                      a freezer compartment, the issue might originate from
                      there. A clogged freezer drain can cause water to overflow
                      into the refrigerator section. Check the freezer drain for
                      any obstructions and clear them if necessary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Damaged Door Seal: </b>A faulty door seal can allow
                      warm air to enter your refrigerator, leading to
                      condensation and water buildup. Ensure that the door seals
                      are intact and creating a proper seal when closed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Improper Leveling: </b>If your refrigerator isn't
                      level, it can cause water to pool in specific areas. Use a
                      level to check your appliance and adjust the legs as
                      needed to ensure it is sitting evenly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>High Humidity: </b>In areas with high humidity,
                      condensation can form more easily inside the refrigerator.
                      Ensure that your refrigerator is set to the correct
                      temperature and try to minimize the frequency of opening
                      the door to reduce humidity levels inside.
                    </li>
                  </ol>

                  <b>Steps to Resolve the Issue:</b>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Unplug your refrigerator to avoid any electrical hazards.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Inspect the defrost drain and clear any blockages using a
                      pipe cleaner or warm water.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Check the door seals and replace them if they are damaged
                      or worn out.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Ensure your refrigerator is level using a spirit level and
                      adjust the legs accordingly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Examine the freezer drain for any clogs and clear them if
                      found.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Monitor humidity levels and set the temperature correctly
                      to prevent excessive condensation.
                    </li>
