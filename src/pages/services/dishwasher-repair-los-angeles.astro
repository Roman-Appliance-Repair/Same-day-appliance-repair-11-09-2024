            <p>With comprehensive experience across various dishwasher types, we handle all <strong>dishwasher problems</strong>. Here’s our approach to each:</p>
            <h3><strong>Built-In Dishwasher Repair</strong></h3>
            <p>Built-in dishwashers are standard in many homes, often facing issues like <strong>drain clogs</strong>, <strong>spray arm blockages</strong>, and <strong>heating element failures</strong>. Our technicians inspect and repair each component to restore efficient cleaning and drying.</p>
            <h3><strong>Portable Dishwasher Repair</strong></h3>
            <p>Portable dishwashers are convenient, but they can encounter problems such as <strong>water line clogs</strong>, <strong>float switch malfunctions</strong>, and <strong>door seal leaks</strong>. We thoroughly check for any blockages or faulty parts to keep your portable unit working smoothly.</p>
            <h3><strong>Countertop Dishwasher Repair</strong></h3>
            <p>Countertop dishwashers, while compact, can experience <strong>water flow issues</strong> and <strong>filter clogs</strong>. Our team identifies and resolves these issues, ensuring reliable cleaning without the hassle of hand-washing dishes.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><p><strong>Dishwasher Not Draining</strong>: If water is left after a wash cycle, it’s often due to a <strong>clogged drain</strong>, <strong>filter</strong>, or <strong>drain hose</strong>. We inspect these components, clean or replace them as needed, and ensure proper drainage.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>Dishes Not Getting Clean</strong>: When dishes are still dirty after a wash, it could mean <strong>clogged spray arms</strong>, a malfunctioning <strong>heating element</strong>, or a problem with the <strong>inlet valve</strong>. We troubleshoot and fix these issues so your dishes come out spotless.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>Leaking Dishwasher</strong>: Leaks can result from <strong>damaged door seals</strong>, <strong>cracked hoses</strong>, or <strong>loose water line connections</strong>. We pinpoint the source and make repairs to prevent future leaks that could damage your floors.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>Strange Noises</strong>: Grinding or squealing sounds often indicate <strong>motor issues</strong> or trapped <strong>food particles</strong> in the spray arms. Our technicians check for and fix any misaligned or worn components.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>Dishwasher Not Filling with Water</strong>: This issue can stem from a faulty <strong>float switch</strong>, <strong>inlet valve</strong>, or <strong>door latch</strong>. We assess and replace malfunctioning components to restore water flow and ensure a complete wash cycle.</p></li>

              <li><p><strong>Water Pooling at the Bottom</strong>: Water left at the end of the cycle points to drainage problems or a <strong>blocked drain hose</strong>. Unaddressed, this can lead to more significant repairs, so please call us early.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>Inconsistent Cleaning Cycles</strong>: If your dishwasher stops mid-cycle or doesn’t complete the wash, it could signal an issue with the <strong>control panel</strong> or <strong>motor</strong>. We can troubleshoot these problems to keep your dishwasher running smoothly.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>Unpleasant Odors</strong>: Persistent smells often mean <strong>food particles</strong> are trapped in the filter or drain. Regular cleaning can help, but a professional inspection may be necessary if odors persist.</p></li>
