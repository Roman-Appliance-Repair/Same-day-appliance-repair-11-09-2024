              <p>
                The cost of microwave repair can vary significantly depending on
                several factors, including the type of microwave, the specific
                issue that needs fixing, and the local labor rates. On average,
                microwave repair costs typically range from <b>$50 to $200</b>.
                For minor issues such as a blown fuse or a faulty door switch,
                you might expect to pay on the lower end of this spectrum,
                around <b>$50 to $100</b>. However, more complex problems such
                as a malfunctioning magnetron—the component that generates the
                microwaves—can be more costly, often ranging from <b
                  >$100 to $200</b
                >. It's essential to get a detailed estimate from a qualified
                technician to understand the specific costs involved in your
                repair.
              </p>

              <p>
                Another factor to consider is the age and overall condition of
                your microwave. If your microwave is relatively new and still
                under warranty, repairs might be covered, significantly reducing
                out-of-pocket costs. However, for older models that are no
                longer under warranty, the cost of repairs can add up quickly.
                In some cases, especially if the repair cost is close to or
                exceeds the price of a new microwave, it may be more economical
                to replace the unit altogether. Always weigh the cost of repair
                against the potential benefits of upgrading to a newer, more
                efficient model to make the most cost-effective decision.

                <p>
                  Built-in microwave ovens offer a sleek, integrated look but
                  come with their own set of challenges. Repairing these units
                  often requires more expertise due to their complex
                  installation. A broken microwave door can be particularly
                  problematic as it usually involves more intricate components
                  compared to countertop models. Faulty door switches are still
                  a common issue, but accessing them can be more difficult.
                  Control panel failures are another frequent problem, often
                  requiring the replacement of the entire panel by a qualified
                  technician. Additionally, built-in microwaves are more
                  susceptible to defective magnetrons, which may need to be
                  replaced if the unit stops heating food effectively.

                <h3>Over-the-Range Microwave Ovens</h3>
                <p>
                  Over-the-range microwave ovens combine microwave cooking with
                  a range hood, making them multifunctional but also more
                  complex to repair. They often suffer from the same door switch
                  issues as other types but may also experience problems with
                  the ventilation system. A defective magnetron or high voltage
                  diode can render the microwave useless, necessitating expert
                  advice for a proper fix. The control panel can also fail,
                  requiring a replacement part to restore functionality. Given
